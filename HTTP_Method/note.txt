Node.js provides several HTTP methods that are part of the HTTP protocol. These methods are used in conjunction with the http module to create a server and handle client requests. Hereâ€™s a summary of the common HTTP methods and their usage in Node.js:

Common HTTP Methods
GET

Used to retrieve data from the server.
Example: Fetching a webpage or API data.
POST

Used to send data to the server to create or update a resource.
Example: Submitting a form or uploading a file.
PUT

Used to update an existing resource or create it if it does not exist.
Example: Updating user information.
DELETE

Used to delete a resource from the server.
Example: Deleting a record from a database.
PATCH

Used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
Example: Updating specific fields of a user profile.
OPTIONS

Used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
Example: Used in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) preflight requests.
HEAD

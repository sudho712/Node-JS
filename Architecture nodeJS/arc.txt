Node.js Architecture Overview
Node.js architecture is designed to build scalable and efficient web applications. It is based on an event-driven, single-threaded, non-blocking I/O model. This architecture enables Node.js to handle numerous simultaneous connections with high performance and minimal resource usage.

Key Components of Node.js Architecture
1. V8 JavaScript Engine
Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google.
It converts JavaScript code into machine code, ensuring fast execution.
2. Single-Threaded Event Loop
Node.js operates on a single thread to handle requests, unlike traditional multi-threaded servers.
The event loop processes tasks asynchronously, delegating I/O or heavy operations to worker threads (via libuv).
3. Non-Blocking I/O
I/O operations, such as reading files or querying databases, do not block the main thread.
These tasks are offloaded to background threads or the operating system, and their results are handled via callbacks or promises.
4. libuv
A library that provides an abstraction over asynchronous I/O operations.
It uses an internal thread pool to handle expensive operations like file systems or DNS queries.
5. Event-Driven Programming
Events drive the workflow in Node.js. For example, HTTP requests, file reads, or user actions generate events, which are handled asynchronously by callbacks or event listeners.
6. Modules
Node.js follows a modular approach, with built-in modules like http, fs, and events.
Developers can use custom or third-party modules (via npm) to extend functionality.
How Node.js Works
Client Sends Request:

A client (browser or mobile app) sends an HTTP request to the Node.js server.
Event Loop Receives Request:

The event loop checks if the request requires I/O operations (e.g., file read or database query).
I/O Operations Offloaded:

I/O tasks are sent to libuv's thread pool or OS for execution, allowing the main thread to continue processing other requests.
Callback Execution:

Once the I/O operation is complete, the event loop retrieves the result and executes the corresponding callback.
Response Sent:

The processed result is sent back to the client, completing the request-response cycle.

Key Advantages of Node.js Architecture
Scalability:

Handles thousands of concurrent requests without creating multiple threads.
High Performance:

Event-driven architecture ensures minimal overhead and quick response times.
Resource Efficiency:

Single-threaded model uses fewer system resources compared to multi-threaded architectures.
Real-Time Applications:

Suitable for real-time use cases like chat applications, gaming servers, or live-streaming services.
Cross-Platform:

Runs on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Use Cases for Node.js
Real-Time Chat Applications: Seamlessly handles multiple user connections.
RESTful APIs: Processes high volumes of data requests efficiently.
IoT Applications: Ideal for managing real-time data from devices.
Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Lightweight and efficient for SPAs.
